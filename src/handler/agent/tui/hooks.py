"""Lightweight hook dispatch for external tool integration.

Loads hook configuration from `~/.obdiag/config/hooks.json` and fires matching
commands with JSON payloads on stdin. Subprocess work is offloaded to a
background thread so the caller's event loop is never stalled. Failures are
logged but never bubble up to the caller.

Config format (`~/.obdiag/config/hooks.json`):

```json
{"hooks": [{"command": ["bash", "adapter.sh"], "events": ["session.start"]}]}
```

If `events` is omitted or empty the hook receives **all** events.
