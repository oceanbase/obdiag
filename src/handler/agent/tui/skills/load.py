"""Skill loader for CLI commands.

This module provides filesystem-based skill discovery for CLI operations
(list, create, info, delete). It wraps the prebuilt middleware functionality from
deepagents.middleware.skills and adapts it for direct filesystem access
needed by CLI commands.

For middleware usage within agents, use
deepagents.middleware.skills.SkillsMiddleware directly.
